## Language Backend

The backend of the Pint is effectively a programmatic Solver, simply referred to as a "solver" in this spec. Note, this should not be confused with the "solver" agent in the network. There are numerous commercial solvers that can be targeted, such as [OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/), [Geocode](https://www.gecode.org/), and [Chuffed](https://github.com/chuffed/chuffed).
