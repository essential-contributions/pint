# Appendix

The following sections contain reference material you may find useful in your Pint journey.
Specifically, we will cover the following:

- **Keywords**: A list of all the _keywords_ in Pint, which are reserved and cannot be used as names
  of macros, variables, etc.
- **Compiler Intrinsics**: A list of all available builtin intrinsics in Pint, which can be used to
  perform low level operations.
- **Application Binary Interface (ABI) Spec**: A specification of the _JSON ABI_, which is a
  condensed representation of a smart contract that only exposes its data.
