# Advanced Features

By now, youâ€™ve learned the most commonly used parts of the Pint programming language. We will look
at a few aspects of the language you might run into every once in a while, but may not use every
day. The features covered here are useful in very specific situations. Although you might not reach
for them often, we want to make sure you have a grasp of all the features Pint has to offer.

In this chapter, we'll cover:

- **Invoking Predicates**: how to invoke external local and external predicates.
- **Macros**: how to write reusable code using macros.
