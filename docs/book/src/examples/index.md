# Example

This chapter includes some basic examples that show how Pint code looks like:

- [Counter](./counter.md)
- [Subcurrency](./subcurrency.md)

We will go over each example line-by-line while briefly introducing new concepts. Later, however, we
will cover each new concept in depth in its own chapter. Therefore, the goal of this chapter is not
to teach you everything about Pint but to get you to (hopefully!) appreciate what Pint is capable
off.
