# Common Programming Concepts

This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language and how they work in
Pint. Many programming languages have much in common at their core. None of the concepts presented
in this chapter are unique to Pint, but we’ll discuss them in the context of Pint and particularly
how they work in a constraint-based environment as opposed to imperative environments that you might
be more familiar with.

Specifically, you’ll learn about decision variables, basic types, custom types, comments, and
conditionals. These foundations will be in every Pint program, and learning them early will give you
a strong core to start from.

> **Keywords:** The Pint language has a set of keywords that are reserved for use by the language
> only, much as in other languages. Keep in mind that you cannot use these words as names of
> variables, intents, types, or macros. Most of the keywords have special meanings, and you’ll be
> using them to do various tasks in your Pint programs; You can find a list of the keywords in
> [Appendix A](../appendix/keywords.md).
