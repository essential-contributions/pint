# Language Primitives

This document defines the DSL and its primitives. It serves as a reference for the syntax and the semantics for each of its elements.

## Syntax Overview

Character set, comments, identifiers.

## Literals

Integers, Boolean literals, string literals, etc.

## Types

Booleans, integers, floats, range types, enum types, `address`, arrays, etc.

## Expressions

operators (unary, binary), `if` expressions, etc.

## External calls

Mostly required to inspect the state of the chain via static calls for example.

## Items

include, variable declaration, enum items, assignment, type aliases, **constraint items**, **solve items**, etc.

## Language Backend

The backend of the DSL (or API) that we're building is effectively a "solver" (not to be confused with the "solver" agent in the network). Many commercial solvers exist that can be targeted. We could decide an a standardized JSON output that is generated by the compiler and that can be read and then _solved_ by network participants using any solver (not all solvers are created equal!).
